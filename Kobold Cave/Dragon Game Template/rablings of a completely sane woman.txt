Hit/Hurt/Health Pipeline

Current:
1. Hurtbox finds Hitbox and calls the Hitboxes "got_hit" signal.
2. Hitbox catches its own signal, and checks if event is damage. if it is, 
	call a method from health and supply the event.
3. Health parses the event and it enters the damage pipeline.


Damage Calculation Pipeline

Current
1. Health has a parse event called from the hitbox, it recives an event.
for this example, event is Damage.
2. Health takes some considerations into account and acts as needed.
3. If armour applies, armour calculation takes place and results are emitted.
4. After armour calc, damage has its "apply_to_health" method called,
	the health componet supplies itself as an arg.
	( only happens if damage has amount > 0.0, else terminate here )
5. Health takes needed after damage actions
