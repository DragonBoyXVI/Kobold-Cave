-- Top Priority
- Establish a gameplay loop! How do you win? How do you lose?
You platform through a room with the goal of reaching the end as 
fast as possible. The only time limit being a self imposed one.
You lose if the player hits 0 hp, as there will be many hazards
to consider.
Exploration is rewarded with heals. ( perma collectable? )


-- Maintain the same design principle you had in school,
dont think about it too much, make it work
Technical debt is a lie (lie)

- 0 
Unique to story mode, a simple room with cracks and blood
everwhere. The player starts unconsious and wakes up here

- 1
A fairly safe big room where the player can fuck around with
movement and bombs, and find secrets for doing so.

- 2
Big like the previous room, but much more dangerous.
features a few enemies and traps, and punishes you for falling.

preludes to the big shaft climb in teh next room

- 3
a fairly long vertical climb full of traps and enemies.
falling is heavily punished, use of vertical lanches is 
heavily rewarded.

The shaft belongs to an old drill, so more machine esque
art is needed

- 4
a long horizonal run that features no traps but lots of enemies,
since this is the end of the cave, you're encourage to
just run for it.

returns to the cave style for a bit but fades out to a more
grassy natural one.

- 5 
bossfight! kill the big baddie with bombs while avoiding
rockbold goons
